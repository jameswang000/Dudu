# Welcome to Dudu

Dudu is a desktop, browser based reader app designed for Chinese language learners who want support for reading long passages of Chinese language text. As a high-level summary, readers can paste in a block of text (a mix of Chinese characters, English words, numbers, punctuation, and spaces) into an input box, and then read their block of text in the Dudu reader interface with support from Dudu's click character for dictionary information feature. The goal is to let the reader mostly read the Chinese text on their own, then when they get stuck on a character, they can directly click it to receive the pinyin and English definitions. Reading with Dudu is easy, fun, and educational!

## How to use

To access Dudu, navigate to the following link: https://jameswang000.github.io/Dudu/. Dudu is deployed on Github Pages as a web based React app scaffolded by Vite. For the best user experience, please access Dudu on a desktop device as mobile and tablet layouts do not currently have dedicated support.

The first page you will see is a Welcome Screen, where you are prompted to paste some Chinese language text into the text area field. After pasting in some text, click the "Let's Read!" button to proceed to the Dudu reader.

Once inside the Dudu reader, you can scroll vertically through the displayed text as you would with any other online text document. Clicking a Chinese character will review a popup below it that provides its pinyin and English definitions. Clicking the character again or anywhere outside the reader (outside of the white page) will close the popup. Clicking another character will open the popup for that character instead.

At the bottom of the screen is a toolbar for adjusting the reader's visual layout. The following properties can be controlled:

- Line Spacing: Controls the space between rows of text.
- Character Spacing: Controls the space between Chinese characters or other textual elements within the same row.
- Page Width: Controls how wide the page of text is on the screen.
- Font Size: Controls the size of the display font for all text on the page.

There is also a "Back" button that returns you back to the Welcome page, so that you can paste new text.
